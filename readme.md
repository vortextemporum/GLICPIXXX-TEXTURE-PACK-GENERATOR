This repository creates a fresh new texture pack for "Minecraft for Java". The code gets random images from [GLICPIXXXVER002 GRAND COLLECTION](https://glicpixxx.love/ver002) and replaces the block textures with them.

### HOW TO USE

* Have Python installed in your computer. (probably it will be best to have a version after 3.7)

* clone this repo, cd to its directory

* if you wanna change the texture pack description, edit **pack.mcmeta**

* run in your terminal -> `python generate.py`

* you will have a zipfile named output.zip

* rename it if you want and copy it to resourcepacks folder where your Minecraft is installed.

* The location for Minecraft is usually like this:

```
Windows:	"%APPDATA%\.minecraft\resourcepacks"
macOS:	"~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/resourcepacks"
Linux:	"~/.minecraft/resourcepacks"
```

* Open the game, go to settings / resource packs and choose our new texture pack!

* Enjoy it, and don't forget to tag me on twitter with your screenshots!

* p.s: if you can't do this stuff, you can just copy `exampletexturepack.zip` to minecraft directory to try my example!
